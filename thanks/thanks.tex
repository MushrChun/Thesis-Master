\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Wei Bao who introduces me to the basic of the research topic. The initial conversation before the enrolment of the research pathway during my master degree did encourage me to dip a toe in the water. The consecutive weekly meetings hosted by him further guide me to figure out the situation of the research topic. Besides, I would like to thank Dr. Dong Yuan who refines the idea of the implementation of my system. Better value is delivered, and a more precise target is set.

I would like to thank the quite and decent environment provided by School of Information Technologies with which, my research process goes smoothly. Notably, the PC offered participates as a part of the system in my implementation.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their financial support without which I may not focus on the research.
